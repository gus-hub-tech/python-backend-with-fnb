## Project Overview

This application leverages Django for backend logic, data modeling, and API endpoints, while Bootstrap is used for rapid UI prototyping and responsive design. The goal is to provide a scalable, secure, and maintainable platform for server data management and visualization.

---

## Features

- 🔒 **User Authentication**: Secure login and session management using Django’s authentication system.
- 📝 **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete support for server-side models.
- 📊 **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for data integration and external access.
- 🖥️ **Web Interface**: Responsive Bootstrap-based web views for interacting with data.
- 🛠️ **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend and maintain, with clear separation of concerns.
- 📦 **Requirements Management**: Uses `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
- 🧪 **Example Integrations**: Example code for connecting to the API with Node.js/Express and fetching/displaying server data.
